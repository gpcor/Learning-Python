# Learning Python!

## Objectives:
I will be uploading my code here as I create small projects and learn things of significance. My primary objective is to learn foundational concepts of Python via the following three resources:
1. [ ] Automate The Boring Stuff (free online text)
2. [ ] Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (I own this book)
3. [ ] Talk Python's #100DaysOfCode lessons *Note: I initially started with this but the lessons were a tad too advanced at the time, so I've dialed it back and will perform their challenges as I gain more confidence*
4. [ ] Pybites and HackerRank, because they have great little code challenges that force me to learn new things to solve problems.

At some point I want to be able to come back to this code and refactor, altering it so it becomes more efficient and uses better Pythonic code.

### Programming Daily Log:
* March 31st, 2020: Spent some time today after work doing some typing practice. Then did sections one thru three of Automate the boring stuff Udemy course (Basics, Flow Control, and Functions).
