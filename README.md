# Learning Python!

## Objectives:
I will be uploading my code here as I create small projects and learn things of significance. My primary objective is to learn foundational concepts of Python via the following three resources:
1. [ ] Automate The Boring Stuff (free online text)
2. [ ] Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (I own this book)
3. [ ] Talk Python's #100DaysOfCode lessons *Note: I initially started with this but the lessons were a tad too advanced at the time, so I've dialed it back and will perform their challenges as I gain more confidence*
4. [ ] Pybites and HackerRank, because they have great little code challenges that force me to learn new things to solve problems.

At some point I want to be able to come back to this code and refactor, altering it so it becomes more efficient and uses better Pythonic code.

### Programming Daily Log:
* March 31st, 2020: Spent some time today after work doing some typing practice. Then did sections one thru three of Automate the boring stuff Udemy course (Basics, Flow Control, and Functions). 

* April 1st, 2020: Did some additional typing practice today by spending the entire day making sure I utilized the new typing method. In Python I used the Automate Everything lessons and learned about Try/Except to handle certain explicit errors. I also wrote a complete program (guess the number game) and started working on Lists.

* April 2nd, 2020: I worked more on Lists today and their differen methods and also discovered random.shuffle() by accident. I watched a couple videos about code practices and reviewed a version of my guessing game done by SinfulPhantom, but done in a much more software engineer kind of way (OOP style). It was beautiful and a clear reminder that I have a long way to go but I know where I want to end up.

* April 3rd, 2020: Not much more today. Did some more with Lists and practiced more clean coding techniques. Discovered that Evernote has a Python API. I'd like to make an application that creates a shopping list based on input with item/qty pairs. Once complete, I'd like to be able to push the list to Evernote. Idea is WIP and requires a little more knowledge I think.

* Did not program on 4 April or 5 April, spent the weekend with my wife relaxing and enjoying the nice weather in our backyard during this pandemic. Still hoping to come out of the COVID-19 crisis with more knowledge and programming ability than when it started.

* April 6th, 2020: Finished Lists and started on Dictionaries and Data Structures in my Automate the Boring Stuff Course. I think dictonaries are the way to go for the evernote app. The Key/Value pairs line up nicely with the Item/Qty pairs I mentioned earlier. On the 9th I can start playing video games but I have to make sure it doesn't hinder my programming progress. I need to create a system that makes this easier.

* April 9th, 2020: I finished Dictionaries, Data Structures, and Advanced String Operations in my Automate the Boring Stuff course. I can see where the advanced string operations would be helpful when taking in lots of string data and wanting to make it cleaner, for putting it in a file or database perhaps? I haven't been taking a couple programming breaks as I move to wrap up my final class for the semester. I also do not want to burn myself out by trying to cram too much into too short a period. I forget that I have a little under three years to practice Python before I get out of the Navy and need to worry about becoming employable. I need to take a little more time to enjoy this process.

* April 13th, 2020: I finished the lesson regarding running programs from the command line and started on Regular Expressions on my Automate the Boring Stuff course in Udemy. Last Friday, my primary laptop broke. Fortunately I regular backup this code to my Github repo for learning Python so that wasn't an issue. At the behest of my wife, who does not believe in bandaging a situation with cheap solutions, I was convinced to stop being so meiserly and upgraded to a Macbook. I'm still dialing in the settings for my code environment and some other quality of life items but so far I'm happy to be here. OSX mean less temptation for video games and more code!

* April 16th, 2020: I started working on the REGEX section of Automate the Boring Stuff, and I'm finding it interesting but complex. There are a lot of details that go into search strings or documents as far as disecting matching strings out and getting the match cases correct. It's going to take a little bit of time to get a hang of but I'm sure I will. I can see how the course is teaching us the requisite materials necessary to making webscrapers, read documents, etc. Excited to see what the end of the course looks like.

* April 20th, 2020: I have attempted a few times over the last few days to get some programming in but it's difficult. As the wife and I get more sick (Yay, potential COVID) I find it harder to stay focused and often suffer from brain fog. I managed to use what level of concentration I did have in the successful completion of my last college class for the semester but that's about it. I'll do what I can going forward. I did, however, finish lesson 27 of the Automate the Boring Stuff Udemy course today so I guess some progress is better than none.
