# Learning Python!

## Objectives:
I will be uploading my code here as I create small projects and learn things of significance. My primary objective is to learn foundational concepts of Python via the following three resources:
1. [ ] Automate The Boring Stuff (free online text)
2. [ ] Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python (I own this book)
3. [ ] Talk Python's #100DaysOfCode lessons *Note: I initially started with this but the lessons were a tad too advanced at the time, so I've dialed it back and will perform their challenges as I gain more confidence*
4. [ ] Pybites and HackerRank, because they have great little code challenges that force me to learn new things to solve problems.

At some point I want to be able to come back to this code and refactor, altering it so it becomes more efficient and uses better Pythonic code.

### Programming Daily Log:
* March 31st, 2020: Spent some time today after work doing some typing practice. Then did sections one thru three of Automate the boring stuff Udemy course (Basics, Flow Control, and Functions). 

* April 1st, 2020: Did some additional typing practice today by spending the entire day making sure I utilized the new typing method. In Python I used the Automate Everything lessons and learned about Try/Except to handle certain explicit errors. I also wrote a complete program (guess the number game) and started working on Lists.

* April 2nd, 2020: I worked more on Lists today and their differen methods and also discovered random.shuffle() by accident. I watched a couple videos about code practices and reviewed a version of my guessing game done by SinfulPhantom, but done in a much more software engineer kind of way (OOP style). It was beautiful and a clear reminder that I have a long way to go but I know where I want to end up.

* April 3rd, 2020: Not much more today. Did some more with Lists and practiced more clean coding techniques. Discovered that Evernote has a Python API. I'd like to make an application that creates a shopping list based on input with item/qty pairs. Once complete, I'd like to be able to push the list to Evernote. Idea is WIP and requires a little more knowledge I think.

* Did not program on 4 April or 5 April, spent the weekend with my wife relaxing and enjoying the nice weather in our backyard during this pandemic. Still hoping to come out of the COVID-19 crisis with more knowledge and programming ability than when it started.

* April 6th, 2020: Finished Lists and started on Dictionaries and Data Structures in my Automate the Boring Stuff Course. I think dictonaries are the way to go for the evernote app. The Key/Value pairs line up nicely with the Item/Qty pairs I mentioned earlier. On the 9th I can start playing video games but I have to make sure it doesn't hinder my programming progress. I need to create a system that makes this easier.

* April 9th, 2020: I finished Dictionaries, Data Structures, and Advanced String Operations in my Automate the Boring Stuff course. I can see where the advanced string operations would be helpful when taking in lots of string data and wanting to make it cleaner, for putting it in a file or database perhaps? I haven't been taking a couple programming breaks as I move to wrap up my final class for the semester. I also do not want to burn myself out by trying to cram too much into too short a period. I forget that I have a little under three years to practice Python before I get out of the Navy and need to worry about becoming employable. I need to take a little more time to enjoy this process.
