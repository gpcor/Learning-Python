The JSON is being loaded as Dictionaries, hence why the overwriting of offense counts hasn't been going as planned. The data has been formated as :

{'Offense Tracker': [{'Offense Count': '1', 'Username': 'username'}]}

This is fine, but I need the scheme to be consistent across the board, for example:

{ 
    "Offenders": [
        {
            "Username": "sudz",
            "Offense Count": "1"
        }
        {
            "Username": "tired",
            "Offense Count": "2"
        }
        {
            "Username": "user",
            "Offense Count": "1"
        }
        {
            "Username": "user",
            "Offense Count": "3"
        }
    ]
}

This would be the preferred format for the data. And since we know the json is being loaded as nested dictionaries, I think we an use the builtin iter keys function to check each kv pair for an existing username and then either update it or add a new kv pair.
